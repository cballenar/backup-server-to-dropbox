# Dropbox Server Backup

Guide to backup your server's sensitive data to Dropbox, using AndreaFabrizi's Dropbox Uploader script

## Steps

### Choose directory

In this example we're running everything as `root` and placing all the scripts in `/root/backups/`. Preferably run as any other user.

    mkdir backups
    cd backups

### Install Dropbox Uploader
Dropbox uploader uses different configuration files per user. It will have to be installed for any user you may need it for.

    # download
    curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/master/dropbox_uploader.sh" -o dropbox_uploader.sh

    # make executable
    chmod 744 dropbox_uploader.sh

    # run
    ./dropbox_uploader.sh

    # follow on screen steps to finish installation

### Test
After installing the application you can upload a test file and checking in your Dropbox account if it has successfully uploaded.

    touch test.txt
    ./dropbox_uploader.sh upload test.txt test--received.txt

### Setup a backup script
- Here are two very similar scripts that will backup your MySQL database or directories.
- Grab the script you'd like to use and update all the brackets with your own information
- Notice that there's a `CONFIG_FILE` variable. This is the `.dropbox_uploader` file generated by Dropbox Uploader upon installation. It is placed in the user's home folder. For root this would be `/root/.dropbox_uploader`.
- Make executable
- Run to check if it's working
